<p>The Semantic Librarian is an R Shiny App developed by <a href="https://crumplab.github.io">Matthew Crump</a> (Brooklyn College of the City University of New York), <a href="https://umcognitivesciencelaboratory.weebly.com">Randall Jamieson</a>, Matt Cook (University of Manitoba), and <a href="http://ion.uwinnipeg.ca/~haujla/">Harinder Aujla</a> (University of Winnipeg). We use a vector-space model of word-semantics to all a user to search a set of documents by their semantic similarity. A current version of the app can be found here <a href="https://crumplab.shinyapps.io/SemanticLibrarian">https://crumplab.shinyapps.io/SemanticLibrarian</a>. This version used select experimental journals from the APA (American Psychological Association) corpus, published between the 1890s and 2016.</p>
<p>We have an in-press manuscript at Behavioral Research methods <span class="citation">(Aujla, Crump, Cook, &amp; Jamieson, n.d.)</span>.</p>

<p>There were a total of 27560 abstracts, 24215 authors, and the corpus consisted of 40517 words. We used BEAGLE <span class="citation">(Jones &amp; Mewhort, 2007)</span> to create semantic vectors for each word. Then we created abstract vectors for each article by adding the word vectors together (that were in each article). We also created vectors for each author, as the sum of their abstract vectors. This way, all of the words, abstracts, and authors, can be projected into the same high-dimensional semantic space. As a result, it is possible to compute the semantic similarity between any word, abstract, or author. This blog explores some of these relationships.</p>

<div id="top-10-abstracts" class="section level2">
<h2>Top 10 abstracts</h2>
<p>5/29/2019</p>
<p>What are the top 10 abstracts published in these APA journals? Who knows. What would the measure be?</p>
<p>How about a different question, which 10 abstracts are the most similar to all other abstracts? Let’s find out. Below is a table of the top 10 abstracts that have the highest mean similarity to all of the other abstracts. To find this, I computed the cosine similarity between each abstract vector and every other abstract vector. That results in a 27560 x 27560 similarity matrix. Each column represents the similarities of an article to all the other articles. I computed the mean for each column, then below, I list the top 10 with the largest means.</p>

<p>Interesting. I’ve read a couple of these papers over the years. Estes (1976) is a classic. Whittlesea, Brooks, and Westcott (1994) is a fantastic paper, kind of surprised to see it pop up here.</p>
<p>In many ways I’m not sure what to make of this information. The similarities are all around .93. The abstracts span many years of publication, and multiple journals are represented. Did all of these articles have the same kind of impact on the field? The database currently does not have citation information, and that would be worth adding at some point. At the very least, it wasn’t clear to me before doing this whether the top 10 most similar abstracts would be “good” papers, representing something centrally important about these domains, or whether they would be derivative papers, that are like many other papers, but perhaps not as noteworthy.</p>
<div id="most-similar-papers-by-year" class="section level3">
<h3>Most similar papers by year</h3>
<p>How about one more table. Let’s look at the most similar abstracts for each year. Within in each year, I found the paper that had the highest mean similarity to all other papers (across all years). The table below shows the top papers (highest similarity to the set) across the last 50 years.</p>

<p>Again, not really sure what to make of this list. Some of these papers are familiar to me, some are not. At the very least, this is a data-driven measure of something about these abstracts, but there were also many assumptions built into the construction of the semantic vectors, and it remains unclear how those assumptions would change the outcome here. Nevertheless, it is interesting to speculate that this kind of approach yields information about the quality of articles, in a similar way to the citation analysis used by <span class="citation">Cho, Tse, &amp; Neely (2012)</span>, to create a list of top papers in cognitive psychology.</p>

<h2>Semantically distinct abstracts</h2>
<p>5/30/2019</p>
<p>What are the most semantically distinct abstracts? These might the abstracts with the lowest mean similarity to all other abstracts. In that sense, these abstracts are the ones that are furthest away from the others in semantic space; so they are distinct in terms of their differentness to the entire set. Let’s look at the top 25 and see what we get.</p>

<p>Ok, not really what I was looking for, but sensible. The database contains many entries that are not normal abstracts for empirical papers. They could be editorials by incoming editors, obituaries, and apparently, abstracts not written in English. So, it makes sense that the abstracts above are the kind of abstracts that are most dissimilar to the entire set, which is mostly composed of abstracts for empirical papers.</p>
<p>To look at the abstracts for regular articles, I suppose the database could be tagged, but there are too many entries for me to do that right now. Let’s take a look at the distribution of mean similarity values first, and then perhaps decide to exclude the really rare and weird abstracts based on some exclusion criterion.</p>

<p>It’s too small to see, but there are some abstracts that span the range into the lower values. Let’s take a look at the 25 articles with the lowest mean similarity, starting with a cutoff of .7.</p>

<p>Ok, now we are starting to look at more regular articles. And, what do we see? It seems like mainly older articles. Perhaps not surprising. There are fewer of those in the set, and their abstract lengths are typically shorter than newer articles.</p>
</div>
<div id="central-articles-and-different-metrics" class="section level2">
<h2>Central articles and different metrics</h2>
<p>I previously used mean similarity to look at “central” articles. Let’s use a few more descriptive statistics to get at similar issues. There’s a whole bunch of things to try here. I’m going to start with two things. For example, what if we divide mean similarity, by the standard deviation? There’s some good reasons to do that. But before that, let’s look first at the standard deviation.</p>
<div id="articles-with-highest-standard-deviation" class="section level3">
<h3>Articles with highest standard deviation</h3>
<p>Using the cosine similarity matrix, I computed the standard deviation of similiarity scores in each column. This gives a measure of dispersion for each article. What do the top 25 articles with the lowest standard deviation look like? Whatever these articles are, they are surrounded the most tightly by the other articles.</p>

<p>Well, I don’t think I’ll be going and reading these articles. The top 25, with the lowest standard deviation appear to be mostly older papers.</p>
<p>Now, what I really wanted to do was to divide the mean similarities, by the standard deviations; then looks at the papers with the highest values. Papers with the highest values will be the ones with larger mean similarity, and small standard deviation. These are the kinds of papers that are perhaps the most central inside the set. They are the closest to all other papers, and they surrounded more closely by the other papers.</p>

<p>Huh. Wasn’t expecting this kind of list. Lots of older papers, and a very different list from the earlier section looking at highest mean similarity. Still, curious to look at this same thing by year. So, the next table find the articles withe highest value (mean similarity divided by standard deviation) in each year. I’ll show the last 50 years:</p>

<p>Some good papers in there, but hey, it’s Psych Review. Another aspect is to look entirely within Psych review papers. So, rather than finding which papers in Psych Review are most similar to all other papers, let’s just find the papers that are most similar to the other papers in Psych Review.</p>

<h2>Journals over Time</h2>
<p>I’ll come back here to say more about this when I have the tools to say more. The question is about how the semantic structure of the database changes over time. I have to think more about ways to answer this question.</p>
<p>For now, here is an animation of publications in the different journals over time. The color of the dots represents different journals. More to follow when I get the chance.</p>

<h2>Top 100 most similar authors</h2>
<p>Let’s a look at the most “central” authors in the database. To do this, I computed the similarity between each author and every other author. Every author has a semantic vecctor, which is the sum of their abstract vectors. I created the author similarity matrix, and the found the column means. Then I found the top 100 authors with the highest mean similarity. Below is a 2-d plot using multi-dimensional scaling, showing the top 100 authors.</p>

<p>Well, there they are. Lots of recognizable authors. Daniel Kahneman had the highest mean similarity. He is not in the center, as you might expect. This is partly due to the multi-dimensional scaling solution. The mean similarities for each author are captured by the size of the dot.</p>

<h3>What does it mean?</h3>
<p>06/1/2019</p>
<p>These graphs raise all sorts of questions. It’s stilll not clear to me what is being measured here. Here are a few possibilities. First, we might think of these authors (the top 200 across both graph) as centroids in the space. This is by definition, because the values are mean similarities to all other authors. So, what does it mean to be a centroid?</p>
<p><strong>Number of abstracts:</strong> The more abstracts you write, the more words you use, the more opportunity you have to use the same kinds of words that are used in other abstracts. In other words, authors with more abstracts should tend to have author vectors that have higher mean similarity than authors with fewer abstracts. So are these authors just the ones who have published the most? (note to self to find out).</p>
<p><strong>Influence vs. Influenced:</strong> It would be interesting if mean similarity reflected something about the influence that authors have on the direction of the field. For example, do authros with high men similarity have more influence on other authors, or have they been more influenced by other authors? For example, perhaps centroid authors were the so-called influencers, they go off in a direction in semantic space and other authors then join in; thereby, surrounding the original author, which causes them to becomd a centroid. On the other hand, something like the opposite seems possible. A centroid author could be your “average” author who is producing derivative works similar to everything else in the field. In other words, you could become a centroid if you were copying a lot of different authors work. This second option seems less likely to explain the data. To my eye, the authors in the above two graphs are all fairly well known and respected authors. So, if the measure is picking up on influence, then what do we have? Still lots of questions. Perhaps a semantically inspired H-index?.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Jack of all trades? Semantic diversity:</strong> Author vectors are the sum of their abstracts. If an author publishes widely across the discipline, that is across semantically diverse areas of the discipline; then, their author vector will be closer to more abstracts in different areas. This would presumably raise their mean similarity to all other authors. Authors who publish only in one area, perhaps one that that is relatively siloed compared to others, should have lower mean similarity to all other authors. So, perhaps this list of top 200 authors partly reflects the semantic diversity of their abstract record.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<div id="clusters-keywords-and-automatic-semantic-summaries" class="section level2">
<h2>Clusters, keywords, and automatic semantic summaries</h2>
<p>The semantic librarian uses multi-dimensional scaling and k-means clustering to show a set of abstracts or authors in a 2-d space. Based off of looking at the search results, and my own intuitions, the clusters generally seem to make sense. That is, if you hover over articles in the same cluster they might be about similar kinds of topics.</p>
<p>It would be nice to get a better sense of these clusters. Almost all of them are ad-hoc, in the sense that they get generated on-demand, based off of the the target search item. Perhaps a set of keywords that are representative of the cluster semantics would be useful. How to do that? TBH, I’ve already done this a couple different ways, for example to enable cluster topic viewing like this (triangles are cluster centers):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb21-1" data-line-number="1">knitr<span class="op">::</span><span class="kw">include_graphics</span>(<span class="st">&quot;imgs/cluster.gif&quot;</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="imgs/cluster.gif" /><!-- --></p>
<p>I know there are already ways to do this like topic modelling, which is admittedly something I need to learn more about. However, before learning more about that, I’d rather try to solve the problem myself, so that when I look at the other solutions, I’ll hopefully have a better understanding of the problem they are solving.</p>
<p>For now, a contained solution would be nice. The semantic librarian already represents everything (words, abstracts, authors, etc.) in the same semantic space. So a contained solution would use the space to let it say what it is all about. For example, find a cluster of articles, get the semantic vector for that cluster, then see what words are most similar to the cluster. Let the cluster speak for itself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the clusters do not speak very well for themselves. Or, maybe it’s that they speak too well, and they don’t say what I want them to say. For example, before solving the problem of keywords for clusters, how about the problem of keywords for a single abstract. Let’s take the vector for a single abstract and ask what are the top 20 words, most similar to that abstract.</p>

<p>Alright, the keywords aren’t having a terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad day. But, they’re not really great keywords, and they aren’t that specific to the article. For example, language didn’t even make the list. Actually, I’ll admit that I’m a bit surprised that the keywords were very specific at all. Based on some other attempts, I thought they would be mostly stop words (e.g., the, if, of, at, etc.)</p>
<p>Ok, let’s keep going and try some clustering. I’ll do a search for memory papers, and a separate search for perception papers. I’ll get the cluster centers for each search, and then look at the top most similar words.</p>

<p>Hmmm, I was thinking this was going to be worse that it is. The key words for memory in general seem very fitting to me. Some of the keywords for perception are more useless (e.g., effect, effects, use, type, role). Still, not a bad place to start from.</p>
<div id="getting-keywords-for-clusters-on-a-graph" class="section level3">
<h3>Getting keywords for clusters on a graph</h3>
<p>I guess I’ll jump ahead to part of the problem: graphically displaying cluster informatin using keywords as part of the plot that Semantic librarian uses to display abstract similarities. Let’s see if I can find some of the code I already wrote for this:</p>
<p>I’ll search for memory, perception, and attention, using OR search, and ask for 3 clusters. OR search will return effectively independent searchs for each of the terms, which should create 3 obviously different clusters.</p>

<p>Hot diggity. Something is happening, and it doesn’t completely suck. Still, there are some issues, for example keywords like “processing” and “performance” show up in multiple clusters, which isn’t ideal for discriminating between clusters.</p>

<div id="better-keywords" class="section level3">
<h3>Better keywords?</h3>
<p>What are the best keywords for an abstract? what are the best keywords for a cluster of abstracts? According to whom?</p>
<p>The process of summarizing text seems a whole lot like reading tarot cards. Sure, there are ways to do it. The problem is the extraordinary number of ways to do it, and no clear method for evaluating the solutions. C’est la vie. So, if I want to make keyword extraction better, what am I doing, and how do I know if it is working?</p>
<p>For now, I’m going to be the tarot card reader. I’ll look at the keywords and see if I like them. Perhaps later I’ll have other people look at the them and see if they like them. And, maybe much later do some key-word generating model-comparison…</p>
</div>
<div id="improving-keyword-suggestion-subtraction-from-the-average-article" class="section level3">
<h3>Improving keyword suggestion: subtraction from the average article</h3>
<p>First some general issues. Semantic vectors in the Semantic Librarian are created by superposition, a fancy word for adding vectors on top of each other. An abstract vector is the sum of the word vectors in the abstract, and author vector is the sum of the abstract vectors the author wrote. Vectors become more similar to each other as the number of words increases. So, in general, all of the author vectors are more similar to each other compared to the articke vectors, which are on average less similar to each other.</p>
<p>The fact that document vectors become more similar as they contain more words is problematic for keyword suggestion, at least using the present method returning the words with the highest similarity to the document vector. The problem is that as documents grow in length, their vectors become more similar, so they will tend to return the same top keywords. We saw this a little bit already in the above example where words like processing and performance were found as keywords for multiple clusters. So, how to avoid this problem?</p>
<p>Here’s one way:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>get some article vectors</li>
<li>do k-means clustering to get the clusters</li>
<li>compute the average abstract vector, by adding all abstract vectors together, ignoring cluster</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>compute the similarities between the average abstract vector and all of the words in the corpus</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>compute the cluster vectors for each cluster, by adding all the abstract vectors together within clusters</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>compute the similarities between each cluster vector and all words in the corpus (note: the most similar words here would be the same as retrieved from the previous method)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>implement subtraction</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>for each cluster, take the vector of word similarites for the cluster and subtract the vector of word similarities for the average vector from all abstracts</li>
<li>sort the words from largest to smallest, take the top words with the most positive difference scores</li>
</ul>
<p>This implements a kind of competitive keyword suggestion. Cluster vectors should be slightly more similar to words that are more relevant to the cluster, compared to the average abstract vector. Those words, which are presumably more representative of the cluster, will rise to the top.</p>
<p>Another wrinkle on this is to raise the similarities (between word vectors and cluster and average abstract vectors) by some exponent. This is the same trick implemented by MINERVA 2 <span class="citation">(Hintzman, 1984)</span>, which is termed resonance in that model. Raising by a power is a squashing function…or maybe better thought of as a spreading function. It exaggerates the difference between large and small similarity values. Larger values remain relatively large, and smaller values get increasinly smaller. This has the effect of modulating the composition of top keywords in terms of more specific or more general words. In the example code below, I raised the similarities to a power of 3.</p>

<p>Function seems to be working. Now to test it out in the dev version of the app. Fingers crossed… Ok, that’s done. Keeping the new feature close to the chest for the moment, and haven’t updated the main app. I want to try getting keywords a few different ways, before deciding on one, perhaps the option to generate keywords by multiple methods.</p>
<p>What I’ve done so far is pretty much fully unsupervised. That’s neat I guess. The keywords themselves are also not that bad. However, there are a few problems I have with them. I find the terms generally too general. There are useless words mixed in that I don’t think act well as keywords. Finally, these keywords are single words, and “real” keywords made by people can be a a few words, perhaps key phrases, or key n-grams. What to do?</p>
<p>I’ve already tried one other thing that I might bring in here and try again. The APA database contains keywords provided by the original authors. This info could be useful for several reasons. First, methods for auto generating keywords could be tested against the actual keywords generated by authors. That at least would provide some kind of validation of model vs. human generated keywords. I haven’t tried anything that complicated yet.</p>
<p>The keywords provided by authors could also be used as a keyword corpus. Currently, I am using all of the words in the corpus, so any of them could rise to the top as a key word. Restricting the possible keywords down the ones in the list of author-created keywords seems sensible to me. A bonus is that any keys with multiple words could be turned into a composite vector, which provides one way to return more descriptive, multi-word keys. Ok, I’ve convinced myself, should bring that in here and see what it looks like. And, as a sidenote, while thinking about these issues I was wondering about generating multi-word keys automatically. For example, you could find all of the possible bigram word pairs, and then see which of those are most similar to a particular cluster. Could be done, but mildly computationally expensive. Another way to do it would be to restrict the possble n-grams to actual n-grams that occured in the text of the abstracts, this would be like finding the most representative phrases from the abstract to use as keys. That might work too. On to the APA keywords.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, the abstacts in our database have keywords (at least if they were scrape properly, and the original abstract did have keywords associated with it). For example, here’s a few random keywords from 5 random abstracts.</p>

<p>Wow, just look at the keywords for the 5th abstract writing a short novel, save it for the paper. Using these keywords will take some pre-processing…Alright, let’s go find that other code and give it a spin. I’ll just get the keywords from the 10,000 most recent abstracts.</p>

<p>Spooky. Keywords tell me more. Have to say, maybe better than not half bad. I won’t consider this issue closed, but maybe it’s time to move to greener pastures. What next?</p>

<div id="semantic-structure-over-time" class="section level2">
<h2>Semantic structure over time</h2>
<p>I’m really interested in looking at how the semantic structure of the APA database changes over time. In a previous post I made an animation of the abstract space as a function of journals over time. That was before I got the keywords working well. It would be neat to see how the semantic structure changes over time, perhaps using keywords. Puts on thinking cap.</p>

<h2>Look and feel</h2>
<p>Need to take a break from deep dives into the semantic structure of the APA database (will come back to this later). The pressing issue this morning is look and feel, specifically the pop-up information that get’s displayed when you hover over an abstract in the Semantic Librarian, which currently shows the abstract title. I’m using the <code>plotly</code> package to add hover labels. I already fixed one annoying issue, which was to wrap titles that had too manwy words in them. I did that by injecting HTML into the text for the hover label. Now I am wondering how much more CSS styling I can inject, to show more useful information in a more useful way. Also, the other day I came across the <code>highcharter</code> package, which is an alternative graphing package (R wrapper for the javascript library). <code>highcharter</code> looks pretty darn cool, and appears to support more options for styling pop-up displays. However, this would take me out of the <code>ggplot2</code> universe, and into unknown territory. Not a bad thing, but probably time consuming. So, step 1 is to figure out if I can inject more stuff into the plotly hover labels.</p>
<p>Let’s try something simple out. I’ll add a new lines for a few things and see what happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attempted to add h4, and p elements, but this showed the HTML code. Hmmm, inserted <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> had worked, need to do some more tinkering.</li>
<li>Aahh, a quick search tells me that plotly only supports some HTML elements <a href="https://plot.ly/javascript/reference/#scatter-hoverinfo">https://plot.ly/javascript/reference/#scatter-hoverinfo</a>, let’s see what I can do with that…</li>
<li>Adding new lines is easy. But, can’t add <code>&lt;div&gt;</code></li>
<li>There is supposed to be support for aligning text, but it doesn’t work properly.</li>
</ul>

W. G. Chase and K. A. Ericsson's (1982) theory that improved memory or memory skills are due to the acquisition of more efficient storage and retrieval processes using long-term memory (LTM) is presented. This theory specifies 3 principles that characterize the structure of memory skills: (1) Information rapidly stored in LTM is encoded in terms of knowledge structures in semantic memory (meaningful encoding); (2) during storage in LTM, special retrieval cues are explicitly associated with the memory encoding of the presented information (retrieval structure); and (3) encoding and retrieval operations using LTM can be dramatically sped up by practice, making the rate of information storage in LTM comparable to that of short-term memory. Empirical evidence of the exceptional performance of a large number of memory experts is examined in the light of these principles. It is contended that strong evidence for these principles has also been found for normal Ss, when they are given more than a couple of hours of practice or training on memory tasks. It is concluded that expert memory skill is related to normal Ss' superior memory for meaningful information.

Following a brief discussion of comparative and physiological considerations, a research strategy to test for efferent involvement in human visual perception is presented. In 7 demonstration experiments, predictions from efferent considerations are used to create a new set of illusions of direction and extent and to demonstrate new predictable variations in the magnitude of some classical illusion figures. Another demonstration illustrates that systematic changes in visual perception occur as a function of changes in motoric demands, even in the absence of any configurational changes in the stimulus. The relationship between attenuation and efferent readiness and their interaction in the formation of the conscious visual percept are illustrated.

Each of 2 converging approaches led to findings that deny this hypothesis. The 1st approach examined performance when Ss determined which digit was missing when 8 different digits appeared sequentially in random order. Although this task requires memory for digits, it does not exhibit the properties of short-term memory span (sensitivity to rhythmic patterning and acoustic/articulatory interference). Thus, there must be a working memory that is distinct from the span memory of an ordered-recall task. The 2nd approach required that Ss perform information-processing tasks during the retention interval of memory span. According to the hypothesis that working memory and memory span are equivalent, interference should occur in this paradigm. There was no such interference provided that an initial rehearsal period for the memory span was allowed prior to the intervening task.

For speeded visual discrimination, response times are faster for multiple redundant targets than for single targets because of probability summation and/or signal integration. This redundancy gain was unaffected when attention was exogenously diverted from the targets but was completely eliminated when attention was endogenously diverted. This was not a result of weaker manipulation of exogenous attention because our exogenous and endogenous cues similarly affected overall response times. Thus, whereas exogenous attention is superior for processing single targets, endogenous attention plays a unique role in allocating resources crucial for rapid concurrent processing of multiple targets.","title":"A Unique Role Of Endogenous Visual-Spatial Attention In Rapid Processing Of Multiple Targets.","journal":"Journal Of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception And Performance","authorlist":"Guzman-Martinez, Emmanuel; Grabowecky, Marcia; Palafox, German; Suzuki, Satoru;","issue":"4","volume":37,"wrap_title":"A Unique Role Of Endogenous Visual-Spatial <br> Attention In Rapid Processing Of Multiple <br> Targets.<br>Guzman-Martinez, Emmanuel; Grabowecky, Marcia; Palafox, German; Suzuki, Satoru;<br>Journal Of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception And Performance","year":2011,"index":17608,"Similarity":0.985,"X":0.0297576561822438,"Y":-0.066623959143059,"cluster":"2","x":0.0297576561822438,"y":-0.066623959143059,"size":0.985,"color":"#21908C","colorv":"2","z":0.985},{"abstract":"\"Judged strength of the depth impression increased with increasing numbers of spots and, to a lesser degree, with increasing perspective.

Three experiments investigated the role of awareness in orienting visual attention. Endogenous and exogenous components of orienting attention were placed in opposition to each other to assess the automaticity of exogenous orienting by examining the potential for brief stimulus events to capture attention in the absence of subjective awareness.

The interference task prevented rehearsal, necessitating the retrieval of the memory set from long-term memory in variably mapped (VM) conditions. Performance in consistently mapped (CM) conditions provided strong support for memory-based theories of automaticity. With CM practice, both the effects of memory load and the effect of the interference task were eliminated. Furthermore, there was a temporal coupling in the reduction of these two effects with consistent practice. Monte Carlo simulations of memory-based automaticity predict such a temporal coupling.

However, many cognitive activities seem to require larger temporary memory stores. Here, we provide evidence for a temporary memory store with much larger capacity than past WM capacity estimates. Further, based on previous WM research, we show that a single factor—proactive interference—is sufficient to bring capacity estimates down to the range of previous WM capacity estimates. Participants saw a rapid serial visual presentation of 5–21 pictures of familiar objects or words presented at rates of 4/s or 8/s, respectively, and thus too fast for strategies such as rehearsal. Recognition memory was tested with a single probe item. When new items were used on all trials, no fixed memory capacities were observed, with estimates of up to 9.1 retained pictures for 21-item lists, and up to 30.0 retained pictures for 100-item lists, and no clear upper bound to how many items could be retained. Further, memory items were not stored in a temporally stable form of memory but decayed almost completely after a few minutes. In contrast, when, as in most WM experiments, a small set of items was reused across all trials, thus creating proactive interference among items, capacity remained in the range reported in previous WM experiments. These results show that humans have a large-capacity temporary memory store in the absence of proactive interference, and raise the question of whether temporary memory in everyday cognitive processing is severely limited, as in WM experiments, or has the much larger capacity found in the present experiments. .

Both trace selection and trace redintegration appear to play important roles in accounting for individual differences in memory span.","title":"Think Before You Speak: Pauses, Memory Search, And Trace Redintegration Processes In Verbal Memory Span.","journal":"Journal Of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, And Cognition","authorlist":"Hulme, Charles; Newton, Philip; Cowan, Nelson; Stuart, George; Brown, Gordon;","issue":"2","volume":25,"wrap_title":"Think Before You Speak: Pauses, Memory Search, <br> And Trace Redintegration Processes In Verbal <br> Memory Span.<br>Hulme, Charles; Newton, Philip; Cowan, Nelson; Stuart, George; Brown, Gordon;<br>Journal Of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, And Cognition","year":1999,"index":19845,"Similarity":0.9628,"X":0.0713223650691536,"Y":0.0133462335497269,"cluster":"1","x":0.0713223650691536,"y":0.0133462335497269,"size":0.9628,"color":"#440154","colorv":"1","z":0.9628},{"abstract":"A study was conducted in which 133 participants performed 11 memory tasks (some thought to reflect working memory and some thought to reflect short-term memory), 2 tests of general fluid intelligence, and the Verbal and Quantitative Scholastic Aptitude Tests.

In this article, the author shows that it is possible to retain information about only 2-3 actions in visual working memory at once. However, it is also possible to retain 9 properties distributed across 3 actions almost as well as 3 properties distributed across 3 actions, showing that working memory stores integrated action representations rather than individual properties. Finally, the author shows that working memory for observed actions is independent from working memory for object and spatial information. These results provide evidence for a previously undocumented system in working memory for storing information about actions. Further, this system operates by the same storage principles as visual working memory for object information. Thus, working memory consists of a series of distinct yet computationally similar mechanisms for retaining different types of visual information. .

Past research on short-term memory has revealed some evidence for decay and a plethora of evidence showing that short-term memory is worsened by interference. However, none of these studies has directly contrasted decay and interference in short-term memory in a task that rules out the use of rehearsal processes. In this article the authors present a series of studies using a novel paradigm to address this problem directly, by interrogating the operation of decay and interference in short-term memory without rehearsal confounds. The results of these studies indicate that short-term memories are subject to very small decay effects with the mere passage of time but that interference plays a much larger role in their degradation.

The book is organized into three major sections presenting, in turn, a discussion of the distinction between episodic and semantic memory (Chapters 2-6), an outline of a general framework (Chapters 7-9), and an application of the framework to experiments (Chapters 10-14). In the first major section, Tulving goes to great lengths to clarify the distinction between the two memory systems. Semantic memory is knowledge of the world, including language, and could be called generic or categorical knowledge. Episodic memory, in contrast, is recollection in which the recollector is part of the memory, and is thus personal and autobiographical memory for events occurring in particular places at particular times. In addition to clarifying the distinction, Tulving directly addresses some possible misinterpretations. For example, the episodic and semantic systems are interdependent rather than exclusive, and they share many properties that are properties of memory in general. Additionally, the two systems are not exhaustive, but rather are two facets of an overall memory system that includes, for instance, procedural memory as an important system. Tulving thus presents the episodic and semantic systems as but two interdependent pieces from some as yet unknown picture of the whole memory system.

In particular, set-size effects in accuracy visual search are measured with either 1 or 2 possible targets. For 1-target tasks, set-size effects are smaller for identification than localization; for 2-target tasks, set-size effects are larger for identification than localization. The observed crossover interaction is inconsistent with a privileged processing hypothesis for either identity or location. Furthermore, this interaction is predicted by an independent channel model based on signal detection theory, in which the details of each decision determine the relative magnitude of the set-size effects. This result is consistent with the similar processing of identity and location, and it refutes the privileged processing hypothesis for either identity or location.","title":"Set-Size Effects For Identification Versus Localization Depend On The Visual Search Task.","journal":"Journal Of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception And Performance","authorlist":"Busey, Tom; Palmer, John;","issue":"4","volume":34,"wrap_title":"Set-Size Effects For Identification Versus <br> Localization Depend On The Visual Search Task.<br>Busey, Tom; Palmer, John;<br>Journal Of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception And Performance","year":2008,"index":17206,"Similarity":0.958,"X":-0.0198198806340911,"Y":0.00364449383841488,"cluster":"3","x":-0.0198198806340911,"y":0.00364449383841488,"size":0.958,"color":"#FDE725","colorv":"3","z":0.958},{"abstract":"Describes a theory of human memory in which a distinction is made between 3 memory stores: the sensory register, and the short- and long-term stores. Primary emphasis is given to the processes by which information is stored in and retrieved from the long-term store, a store which is considered to be a permanent repository for information. Forgetting and related phenomena are attributed to a failure of the retrieval process, in which the search through some memory area becomes less efficient as new information is placed in it. Storage and retrieval in the long-term store are conceived of as parallel processes, one mirroring the other, and each is divided into 3 stages for conceptual clarity. The memory trace is viewed as an ensemble of information stored in some memory location, the location of storage determined largely by the components of the ensemble itself. The ability of the system to cope with diverse phenomena is demonstrated by a number of selected experimental paradigms.

First, both tasks were unaffected by divided-attention tasks known to impact other priming tasks. Second, both tasks were unaffected by a manipulation of selective attention in which colored words were either named or their colors identified. Thus, category verification, unlike other conceptual tasks, appears unaffected by divided attention, and some selective-attention tasks, and lexical decision, unlike other perceptual tasks, appears unaffected by a difficult divided-attention task and some selective-attention tasks. Finally, both tasks were affected by a selective-attention task in which attention was manipulated across objects (rather than within objects), indicating some susceptibility to selective attention. The results contradict an analysis on the basis of the conceptual-perceptual distinction and other more specific hypotheses but are consistent with the distinction between production and identification priming.","title":"Attention And Implicit Memory In The Category-Verification And Lexical Decision Tasks.","journal":"Journal Of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, And Cognition","authorlist":"Mulligan, Neil W.; Peterson, Daniel;","issue":"3","volume":34,"wrap_title":"Attention And Implicit Memory In The <br> Category-Verification And Lexical Decision Tasks.<br>Mulligan, Neil W.; Peterson, Daniel;<br>Journal Of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, And Cognition","year":2008,"index":20779,"Similarity":0.9573,"X":0.0582844423635253,"Y":-0.0413562464633859,"cluster":"2","x":0.0582844423635253,"y":-0.0413562464633859,"size":0.9573,"color":"#21908C","colorv":"2","z":0.9573},{"abstract":"A temporal integration model is proposed that predicts the results reported in 4 psychophysical experiments.

Here we report a robust illusion that involves the misperception of moving, partially occluded objects. When a dynamically occluded object is seen through 2 misaligned apertures, the object appears misaligned in the direction of the apertures, creating the Aperture Capture Illusion. Specifically, when part of a dynamically occluded object disappears behind an occluding surface and then another part of the object comes into view immediately afterward, the 2 parts appear misaligned in the direction of the offset of the apertures through which they were seen. This illusion can be nulled: Separating the 2 object parts to increase the time interval between their appearance produced the percept of alignment. The ability to null the illusion in this manner demonstrates that dynamically occluded regions of moving objects continue to persist in perceptual awareness but, we argue, are perceived to move at a slower velocity than visible regions.

The results of Experiment 3 suggest that the retrieval of a delayed intention, or the prospective component, can require capacity.","title":"The Cost Of Remembering To Remember In Event-Based Prospective Memory: Investigating The Capacity Demands Of Delayed Intention Performance.","journal":"Journal Of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, And Cognition","authorlist":"Smith, Rebekah E.;","issue":"3","volume":29,"wrap_title":"The Cost Of Remembering To Remember In <br> Event-Based Prospective Memory: Investigating The <br> Capacity Demands Of Delayed Intention <br> Performance.<br>Smith, Rebekah E.;<br>Journal Of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, And Cognition","year":2003,"index":20240,"Similarity":0.9546,"X":0.102749570424617,"Y":-0.0104682569385923,"cluster":"1","x":0.102749570424617,"y":-0.0104682569385923,"size":0.9546,"color":"#440154","colorv":"1","z":0.9546},{"abstract":"A study of the latency and probability of occurrence of visual recognition of percepts on Rorschach ink blots when affected by practice, difficulty of percepts, and learning of second additional percepts.

In Exp I, novel 2-dimensional wire figures were first shown in 1 orientation in the sagittal plane, and recognition of them was then tested in an altered orientation in that plane. In Exp II, novel 3-dimensional wire figures were first shown in 1 orientation, and recognition of them was tested following rotation about one of the 3 major axes of space. It was hypothesized that (a) form perception is the end result of a process of figural description; (b) orientation change that alters the perceived location of the top, bottom, and side of a figure will affect this description; and (c) front-back reversal and rotations about the Y axis will not affect the description because front and back constitute the sides of a figure as much as left and right do, and all figural sides are phenomenally equivalent. Findings support these hypotheses except for an unanticipated effect on recognition of 90° rotations about the Y axis. This effect is seen as a previously unknown example of egocentrism in perception, since the description is governed by the retinal projection resulting from the particular vantage point of the observer.

A cyclist riding beside a pair of sagging chains that connect fence posts appears to move up and down with the chains. In this illusion, a static shape (the chains) affects the perception of a moving shape (the bicycle), and this influence involves assimilation (averaging) rather than opposition (differentiation). These features distinguish the illusion from illusions of motion capture and induced motion. The authors take this bicycle illusion into the laboratory and report 4 findings: Naïve viewers experience the illusion when discriminating horizontal from sinusoidal motion of a disc in the context of stationary curved lines; the illusion shifts from motion assimilation to motion opposition as the visual size of the display is increased; the assimilation and opposition illusions are dissociated by variations in luminance contrast of the stationary lines and the moving disc; and the illusion does not occur when simply comparing two stationary objects at different locations along the curved lines. The bicycle illusion provides a unique opportunity for studying the interactions between shape and motion perception.","title":"The Bicycle Illusion: Sidewalk Science Informs The Integration Of Motion And Shape Perception.","journal":"Journal Of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception And Performance","authorlist":"Masson, Michael E.

However, such immediate and direct forms of guidance from working memory are less helpful over extended delays or when other related information in long-term memory is useful for reaching these goals. Here we show that information that was encoded in the past but is no longer present or relevant to the task also guides attention. We examined this by associating multiple unique features with novel shapes in visual long-term memory (VLTM), and subsequently testing how memories for these objects biased the deployment of attention. In Experiment 1, VLTM for associated features guided visual search for the shapes, even when these features had never been task-relevant. In Experiment 2, associated features captured attention when presented in isolation during a secondary task that was completely unrelated to the shapes. These findings suggest that long-term memory enables a durable and automatic type of memory-based attentional control.","title":"Incidental Biasing Of Attention From Visual Long-Term Memory.","journal":"Journal Of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, And Cognition","authorlist":"Fan, Judith E.; Turk-Browne, Nicholas B.;","issue":"6","volume":42,"wrap_title":"Incidental Biasing Of Attention From Visual <br> Long-Term Memory.<br>Fan, Judith E.; Turk-Browne, Nicholas B.;<br>Journal Of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, And Cognition","year":2016,"index":21892,"Similarity":0.954,"X":0.0512526635621981,"Y":-0.0193209346466293,"cluster":"1","x":0.0512526635621981,"y":-0.0193209346466293,"size":0.954,"color":"#440154","colorv":"1","z":0.954},{"abstract":"In retrospective memory, performance predictions have been found to enhance performance on subsequent memory tests. In prospective memory, the influence of metacognitive judgments on performance has not been investigated systematically. In the present study, 140 undergraduate students performed a complex short-term memory task that included a prospective memory task. Half of them gave performance predictions after the prospective memory task instructions. In addition, the specificity of the prospective memory task was manipulated by instructing participants either to perform an action when a word that belongs to the category of musical instruments was presented or to respond when the word “trumpet” was presented. The results showed that performance predictions enhanced performance, but only for the categorical task. Additional analyses of retrieval experience showed that performance predictions lead to an increase in search experiences while cue specificity was accompanied by an increase in pop up experiences. The results indicate that performance predictions can improve prospective performance and thus may be a valuable strategy for assisting prospective memory. .

<p>Highchart is awesome. Wow, I like that. But, I would still like a plotly solution, and I just came across <code>hovertemplate</code> which is supposed to give more control over the hoverlabel. Let’s try that out…………. Well, nothing to see here. Many moons went by. I could change the opacity of the background, but it also changed the opacity of the text. I could not left align the text. I have failed to understand the intrinsic logic of plotly CSS.</p>
