The Semantic Librarian currently searches 27,560 APA article abstracts from experimental psychology journals between the years 1894 - 2016.

### Searching

Search is conducted using the similarity in semantic meaning between search terms and articles. Enter any word or combinations of words, and the Semantic librarian will return the most semantically similar articles to those terms.

### Query style

The query style options change how the search is conducted.

- **Compound:** Compound search is the default. Here, the semantic meaning of each search term is added together into a compound vector. The sum total of the semantic meaning of all the search words is used to find the most similar articles
- **AND:** AND search is similar to compound search, except the vectors for the search terms are multiplied by each other rather than summed. The product of the search vectors is used to find the most similar articles.
- **OR:** OR search attempts to treat each seach word independently, and return a merged list of highly similar articles to all terms. E.g., searching Perception OR Memory should return the top articles most related to perception and the top articles most related to memory.
